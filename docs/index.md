## Work Experience

**Machine Learning Engineer** | Pison Technology <br>
<small><span style="color: gray;">*Full-time · Oct 2022 - Present · 2 yrs 5 mos*</span></small>

- Conducted over 1,200 TensorFlow experiments for sleep stage classification, resulting in an 11% improvement in the baseline model’s F1-score (ongoing). Developed custom loss functions to address class imbalance. Enhanced model performance and speed by implementing a custom attention layer that facilitated feature mining, reducing the feature set by an order of magnitude while boosting overall performance.
- Developed and optimized real-time gesture detection models. Wrote Cythonized extension modules, and vectorized bottleneck functions in the gesture pipeline, significantly improving speed of online prediction and offline modeling.
- Lead a “Hackaweek” project with two colleagues to implement a state-of-the-art domain-invariant classification network in PyTorch, following the approach outlined in its original manuscript.
- Lead the adoption of a data warehouse solution (Bigquery) to address data needs. Wrote various Python wrappers around Bigquery client to improve the team's productivity and work reproducibility.
- Deployed and monitored online and batch ML models using Google's Model Registry and Cloud Run Functions. 
- Wrote a scalable ETL pipeline using Apache Beam which brought down compute time from 2 days to 15 minutes at a cost of 25 cents.
- Took ownership of the Python code base standardization, CI/CD, and dependency management. Ensured developers on different operating systems can cooperate seamlessly and reliably. Produced a versioned documentation website, automatic releases, and platform-specific wheels building and publishing to Google Artifact Registry. 
- Maintained communication with key colleagues from other teams to ensure consistency and optimal integration of developed solutions.

**Research Assistant** | University of Massachusetts Lowell <br>
<small><span style="color: gray;">*Part-time · May 2021 - June 2022 · 1 yrs 1 mos*</span></small>

- Read tens of papers about multi-agent networks and cooperative dynamics. Implemented Reinforcement Learning agents and environments for multi-agent search and rescue (SAR) simulations.
- Wrote equations to describe the emergent cooperation dynamics of SAR agents in the conducted simulations.
- Gained insights into the distinction of top-down vs. bottom-up cooperation structures and the strengths and weaknesses of each. 


**Advanced Graduate Project Research Assistant** | University of Massachusetts Lowell <br>
<small><span style="color: gray;">*Part-time · Jan - May 2021 · 5 mos*</span></small>

- Researched, compared, and recommended edge-compatibly image classification, segmentation and object detection solutions using multi-modal data. 
- Learned the YOLOv3 architecture and ran numerous object detection experiments on a computer cluster. 
- Doubled the amount of data by using generative AI, mining publicly available datasets, and implementing suitable data augmentation techniques. 

**Engineering Co-Op** | Rockwell Automation Inc. <br>
<small><span style="color: gray;">*Full-time · Jan - July 2020 · 6 mos*</span></small>

- Co-authored Python scripts to provide full control over a motor controller, company proprietary hardware, power supplies, and a temperature chamber.
- Collaborated with colleagues over GitLab to refactor and write test scripts to remotely control lab power supplies.
- Wrote data visualization scripts with Python and Matlab, and discussed results with management.
- Developed a test GUI to provide dynamic control over test devices and allow for repeated testing.
