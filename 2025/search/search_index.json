Developed two custom loss functions to address class imbalance. Implemented a custom attention layer and used it for feature mining, improving performance while reducing the feature set by an order of magnitude.</li> <li>Developed and optimized real-time biosignal gesture detection models. Wrote Cythonized extension modules, and vectorized bottleneck functions in the gesture pipeline, significantly improving the speed of online prediction and offline modeling.</li> <li>Led a \u201cHackaweek\u201d project with two colleagues to implement a state-of-the-art domain-invariant classification network with adversarial training in PyTorch, following the approach outlined in its original manuscript.</li> <li>Led the adoption of BigQuery as a data warehouse solution to streamline data access and management.</li> <li>Deployed and monitored streaming and batch ML models using Google's Model Registry and Cloud Run Functions. </li> <li>Wrote a scalable ETL pipeline using Apache Beam which brought down the compute time of 56 GB of data from 2 days to 15 minutes at a cost of 25 cents.</li> <li>Standardized the Python codebase, CI/CD workflows, and dependency management, enabling seamless collaboration across operating systems. Implemented automated documentation, versioned releases, and platform-specific wheels publishing to Google Artifact Registry.</li> <li>Maintained cross-team communication to ensure consistency and optimal integration of ML solutions.</li> </ul> <p>Research Assistant | University of Massachusetts Lowell  Part-time \u00b7 Jan 2021 - June 2022 \u00b7 1 yrs 6 mos</p> <ul> <li>Exalabs Team: Researched the literature on multi-agent networks and cooperative dynamics. Implemented Reinforcement Learning agents and environments for multi-agent search and rescue (SAR) simulations. Analyzed top-down vs. bottom-up cooperation structures, identifying their respective strengths and weaknesses.</li> <li>Advanced Graduate Project: Researched, compared, and recommended edge-compatible image classification, segmentation and object detection solutions using multi-modal data.  Learned the YOLOv3 architecture and ran numerous object detection experiments on a computer cluster.  Doubled the dataset size through generative AI, public dataset mining, and data augmentation. </li> </ul> <p>Engineering Co-Op | Rockwell Automation Inc.  Full-time \u00b7 Jan - July 2020 \u00b7 6 mos</p> <ul> <li>Co-authored Python hardware test scripts and GUI.</li> <li>Wrote data visualization scripts with Python and Matlab, and discussed results with management.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#education","title":"Education","text":"<ul> <li>M.S.
